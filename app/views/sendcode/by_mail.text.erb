Dear <%= @forename %>

Thank you for using <%= SITE_TITLE %>.

The access code for <%= raw @service.organisation.name %> is <%= @permission.access_code %>

To enter the access code visit <%= SITE_URL %>, login (if you
didn't select "Remember me" when you logged in before) and click on [Dashboard]
on the menu down the left hand side.  You have until <%= @permission.created_at + 2.weeks - 1.day %>
to enter the access code.  If you (any anybody else) make three incorrect attempts
to enter the access code it will become invalid.

Once the access code has been entered you will be able to update the service
details (again accessed via the Dashboard).

  If you have any problems please visit our support site at http://support.reallycare.org.
