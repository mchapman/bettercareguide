For the attention of <%= @forename %> <%= @surname %>



Dear <%= @forename %>,

Thank you for using <%= DOMAIN_NAME %>.

The access code for <%= raw @service.organisation.name %> is <%= @permission.access_code %>

To enter the access code visit <%= SITE_URL %>, login (if you
didn't select "Remember me" when you logged in before) and click on [Dashboard]
on the menu down the left hand side.  You have two weeks and three
attempts to enter the access code.

Once the access code has been entered you will be able to update the service
details (again accessed via the Dashboard).

If you have any problems please visit our support site at http://support.reallycare.org.
